**Add Files**
Use drag-and-drop to add any .flac and .wav files, as well as FLAC.exe files. You may also drag the whole folders.

**Detect Duplicates**
Click the "Detect dupes" button to find audio duplicates (including duplicates between .wav and .flac). Found duplicates will be moved to the top of the list and unchecked. You can use the "Clear unchecked" button to remove repeated duplicates.

**Encode and Decode**
Use the "Encode" or "Decode" buttons to measure resulting speed and file size with different encoder settings. A single click on the "Encode" or "Decode" button will process all checked files in the lists.

**Job List**
You can use the "Job List" to test various presets with different binaries and audio files.

**Temporary Files**
Temporary encoded and decoded files are stored in the "temp" folder in the app's directory by default but can be changed. It is recommended to set this to a RAM drive for improved performance.

**Log Analysis**
Log entries can be sorted by clicking on the column headers. Analyze the log by pressing the button to find the smallest resulting file size and sort the log. Then use "Log to Excel" for further analysis.

Note:
You may test any builds of FLAC starting from 1.5.0.
If you want to use earlier FLAC versions then set 'Threads' option to 1.
